# 🌉 Cross-Generation

**Cross-Generation** is a full-stack web application that bridges the generational gap by enabling **senior citizens** to learn modern technologies and helping **younger users** understand traditional knowledge, values, and skills from elders.

- Helps **elders** get familiar with new tools (social media, online banking, etc.).
